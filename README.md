# RestaurantMenuWithPuppeteer

This simple Puppeteer script uses a headless browser window to fetch the daily menu from my school campus student restaurant Foodoo. The application prints the daily menu to the console
when the application is launched

**Instructions to launch the application**
- Clone the repository locally
- Navigate to the root directory and give the following command
> npm install
- To launch the application give the following command
> node app.js
- View the application console (the terminal where you gave the build and launch commands) and see the daily menu
